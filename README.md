Endgame Website

Welcome to the Endgame Website, where you can relive the epic events of Marvel's Endgame! This website features a slider with images of your favorite Avengers, a hamburger menu with clickable names of the main cast members, and posts with information about each avenger. Plus, you can customize the website with your own fonts and colors using the included CSS file.

The website is built using React.js and is designed to be responsive, so it looks great on all devices. The menu changes to a dropdown on smaller screens, making it easy to navigate on the go.

Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a new website theme, the Endgame Website has something for you. So grab your popcorn and get ready for the ultimate Marvel experience!
Getting Started

To run the website locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (the package manager for Node) installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/user/endgame-website.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd endgame-website
    Install the dependencies: npm install
    Start the development server: npm start
    Open a web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

The development server will automatically reload the app whenever you make changes to the code, so you can see your changes in real-time.

Deployment

To build the app for production, run the npm run build command. This will create a production-ready build of the app in the build directory.

To deploy the app to a hosting provider, follow the provider's instructions for uploading a React app. Some common hosting providers for React apps include:

    Netlify
    Heroku
    AWS Amplify

Customization

To customize the look and feel of the website, you can modify the styles in the styles.css file. You can also add your own fonts by including a @font-face rule in the CSS file and linking to the font files.
