#1
Build me a basic html, css and javascript website in the theme of marvel end game. 
It should include the following:
1. A favicon of iron man
2. A title that says "This is the End Game."
3. A slider with images of the avengers (made in css)
4. Footer that says "ChatGPT is the End Game."
5. Hamburger menu with clickable names of each of the main Avengers cast members
6. Posts containers with links for each avenger
7. Post page with spaces for images at the top a summary about each avenger from the menu list

#2
Make the css and html code separate, imagine the css code is in its own file called "styles.css"

#3
Now add the javascript to make it the website more functional, imagine the javascript as a separate file that you can name yourself and link it to the html code which includes the css linking.

#4
Revise the css to customise the div's in the html. The website looks a bit too plain. I want it to look  more like a normal website every user could navigate

#5
Edit either the html or the javascript code so as to make the menu with the list of avengers a drop down. Add some cool fonts for the texts being used on the site. 

#5
The html for the drop down doesn't seem to be working. Try adding the functionality through  the javascript code

#6
Doesn't seem to be working. Let's try recreating this whole solution through react.js

#7
Help structure the project directory and tell me how to run the app in my terminal

#8
Okay, give me the code above again, but at the top include the name of the file that will hold that code

#9
Okay, now write the code for styles.css, index.js and package.json and manifest.json respectively

#10
body {
	font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}

header {
	background-color: #333;
	color: #fff;
	padding: 20px;
	text-align: center;
}

h1 {
	margin: 0;
	font-size: 2em;
	font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
}

nav {
	position: relative;
	background-color: #333;
	height: 50px;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: space-between;
	padding: 0 20px;
	box-sizing: border-box;
	z-index: 2;
}

.menu-icon {
	display: none;
}

@media (max-width: 992px) {
	.menu-icon {
		display: block;
		position: absolute;
		top: 20px;
		right: 20px;
		cursor: pointer;
	}

	.menu {
		display: none;
	}

	.menu-

Your code isn't complete

#11
Write me a catcy readme for the theme of this website

#12
Write me the code for index.html

#13
Write me the code for index.html while keeping in mind the structure of the project files

#14
Give me those steps to run it again please
Certainly! Here are the steps for running a React app locally:

    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal: cd endgame-website
    Install the dependencies: npm install
    Start the development server: npm start
    Open a web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

The development server will automatically reload the app whenever you make changes to the code, so you can see your changes in real-time.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
